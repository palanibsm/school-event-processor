# Google Calendar Reminder Setup (One-Time)

When you add events using the Google Calendar links from this app, they use Google Calendar's **default reminder settings**. By default, Google Calendar only adds a single 30-minute reminder.

Follow the steps below to set up **two reminders** (1 day before + 30 minutes before) so every new event you add gets both automatically.

## Google Calendar on Web (Optional)

If you also use Google Calendar on your computer:

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) in your browser
2. Click the **gear icon** (top-right) and select **Settings**
3. In the left sidebar, click **Event settings** under General
4. Scroll down to **Notifications**
5. You will see a default reminder - click **Add notification**
6. Set the two reminders:
   - **30 minutes**
   - **1 day**
7. Changes are saved automatically

## How It Works

- These default reminders apply to **all new events** you add to Google Calendar
- Events added via the "Add to Google Calendar" links from this app will automatically get both reminders
- You can always adjust reminders for individual events after adding them
- This is a one-time setup - you don't need to do it again

## Using the .ics File Instead

If you download the `.ics` file from the app, the two reminders (1 day + 30 minutes) are **already embedded** in the file. No setup needed - they will appear automatically when you import the file.
